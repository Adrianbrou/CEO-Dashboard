POWER BI eshop : CEO Dashboard
Feb 2026 - Feb 2026Feb 2026 - Feb 2026
Eshopp : Business Intelligence Dashboard Project I built Eshopp, a Business Intelligence dashboard designed for e-commerce analytics environment using Microsoft Power BI. This project focuses on transforming raw CSV data into a structured, scalable data model that supports business decision-making. - What This Project Integrates: Customer Demographics – analyzing buyer behavior and segmentation Sales Performance – tracking revenue trends and transaction data Product Catalog Insights – evaluating pricing and category performance Geographic Analysis – identifying regional growth opportunities Website Sessions – connecting user engagement with purchase behavior - Technical Implementation: Built a live data connection from structured CSV sources Designed a semantic model to support relational analysis Structured the initial schema starting with customer-level data Prepared the model for advanced KPIs and performance metrics This dashboard lays the foundation for answering strategic business questions such as: Which regions are driving the highest revenue growth? What is the relationship between website engagement and purchasing behavior? Which products generate the highest lifetime customer value ? 
-Why This Project Matters ?: This isn’t just a report but it’s the beginning of a scalable BI architecture designed to simulate how modern companies use data to drive decisions. I’m continuing to expand this model with: Advanced DAX measures Time intelligence calculations; Role-level security implementation; Performance optimization! 
I personally loved work on this project and think I have learn more on how get my DAX query more relevant and efficient base on the need , and I also learn that a simple clear dashboard is well appreciated by stakeholders than fancy full complicated charged one. What matters is how simple your dash can tell the story and being easy manipulate to tell more stories. Dont forget to update your dash overtime.
